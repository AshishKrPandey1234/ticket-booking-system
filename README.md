# 🎟️ **Ticket Booking System (CLI-Based)**

This project is my **first Java-based Ticket Booking System**, created to strengthen my understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts through a real-world application. It’s a simple **command-line interface (CLI)** program where users can **sign up, log in, search trains, book tickets, and cancel reservations** — all using basic Java features.

I want to give special thanks to **[Lovepreet Singh](https://github.com/AlphaDecodeX)** for his helpful tutorials and projects, which really guided me while building this system. His way of explaining made it easier for me to understand and implement the logic step by step.
